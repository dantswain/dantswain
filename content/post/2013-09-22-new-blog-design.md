I think a lot of developers have this intention of creating and
maintaining a blog.  I started this one over a year ago and have published a
whopping two posts.  I'd call it a success!

After those two posts, I felt it was obviously time for a redesign.
The main purpose of this post is to give credit to some people that
contributed in one way or another to this redesign.

This site is powered by [Octopress](http://octopress.org), which is a
pretty cool framework for blogging.  You get to write posts and pages
in [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/), which is
a pretty pleasant way to write in plain text.  Unfortunately, the
default Octopress theme is... maybe not "ugly" per se, but certainly
more utilitarian than attractive.  The
[Octopress website](http://octopress.org) is a good example.
Fortunately, there are lots of
[themes for Octopress](https://github.com/imathis/octopress/wiki/3rd-Party-Octopress-Themes).
 I went with [foxslide](https://github.com/sevenadrian/foxslide), by
 [Adrian Artiles](http://www.adrianartiles.com/).  Foxslide uses
a great css library called [Twitter Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/).

I also want to give credit to the
[Princeton University President's Lecture Series](http://www.princeton.edu/president/tilghman/presidents_lecture_series/past_president_lectures/).
I extracted the background image of this site from a poster that was
prepared (presumably by their graphic designers) for a lecture by
[Naomi Leonard](http://www.princeton.edu/~naomi), my
Ph.D. Advisor. There is a video of her talk on youtube; it was titled
["Flocks and Fleets: Collective Motion in Nature and Robotics"](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqas_hhMwQ).
I helped prepare a couple of her slides.

The reason I chose this particular background is because it was
constructed using a figure from my research. The figure shows the
trajectories of a group of agents circling a common point with
oscillatory speed. Part of my Ph.D. research was coming up with
provably-stable control laws to coordinate such formations.
That work was motivated by observations that
[banded killifish](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banded_killifish)
behave in a similar fashion.  One benefit of motion with
oscillatory speed is that the fish move relative to
one another in a regular pattern. We showed that such motion
can lead to faster decision making at the group level.
