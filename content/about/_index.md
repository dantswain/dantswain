Hi, I'm Dan.

I'm a fellow at [Simpli.fi](https://simpli.fi).  I work with multiple software
engineering teams to help them tackle some of their toughest challenges.  I've
been working at Simpli.fi for a bit over 5 years now and have worn both
developer and manager hats at various times.

Before working at Simpli.fi, I studied Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering
at Princeton.  My Ph.D. dissertation involved studying the dynamics of decision
making in schools of fish and it was a lot of fun.  I also got to work with
some really great engineers and scientists building some really neat robotics
testbeds.

I grew up in a rural part of northern Pennsylvania and went to Penn State for
an undergrad and masters in Electrical Engineering.  Today I live in the
Rochester, New York, area with my wife.
